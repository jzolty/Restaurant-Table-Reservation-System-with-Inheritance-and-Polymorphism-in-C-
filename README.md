# Restaurant-Table-Reservation-System-with-Inheritance-and-Polymorphism-in-C-
This project is a console application designed to manage table reservations in a restaurant. The application allows users to:
-view available tables,
-make reservations,
-cancel existing reservations.

The program is implemented in C++ and uses text files for storing table and reservation data. This project was an opportunity for me to learn about dynamic memory management, file handling, and implementing singly linked lists and polymorphism.
